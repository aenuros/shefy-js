# Shefy

Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you could read Moby Dick with every character a female character? Neither have I, but now it is possible. This program was inspired by the site owner of 'desiredcreations', who took a popular MBTI profile and [swapped all the pronouns to be feminine ones](https://web.archive.org/web/20180422041753/https://desiredcreations.com/Misc_INTP4Her.html). I thought this was interesting and wanted to automate it a little.

## Future Improvements

It might be interesting to reverse the direction and turn all feminine gender to masculine gender. There could also be the option to turn everything as gender-neutral as possible and use singular they. It may be interesting to read the same text in different configurations.

This also seems like it could easily be turned into an extension for Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. One could select only portions of text or one could do the entire page.
